## Jobs Analysis
First project and introduction to Data Analysis utilizing SQL. The project focuses on utilizing SQL and its functionalities to explore details about the job market, including top-paying jobs and in-demand skills for data analytic roles. 

Check out the SQL queries utilized here: [project_jobs_sql folder](/project_sql/)

Please note that the first five queries were completed by following a tutorial to learn the basics of SQL and data exploration. The remaining queries were created independently to analyze and explore the job market on my own. Credits to: [project_tutorial](/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA&t=12631s/)

# Background 
This project serves as my entry point for exploring data analytics and the languages/tools associated with it. As my first project, I decided to follow a tutorial and to explore the information regarding the job market. 

Data hails from [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). The data includes information regarding job titles and its associated roles, salaries and locations. 

### The questions that I wanted to answer:

 2. What skills are employers looking for in their employees for these top-paying jobs?
 3. What skills are most in-demand for data analysts? 
 4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries (which skills should one focus on developing to land jobs)
 5. What are the optimal skills a person should spend the most time in developing
 6. What are the top-paying jobs in New York City specifically?
 7. What are the most in-demand skills that jobs are looking for in New York City?
